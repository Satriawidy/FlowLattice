# Discrete Learnable Flows for Lattice Field Theory

This is a repository to implement simple discrete learnable flows on 1+1D $\phi^4$ and $U(1)$ theory, following [this notebook tutorial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08176). The difference is that instead of initialising the functions and classes in the notebook, we store them in separate python modules, and call them in the notebook.

In this repository, we also try to reproduce some results from [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12072) and [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06413) papers. More codes and more refined implementations are expected to come in the future!
